Description: A gate-keeping procedure to test a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks. Computations related to group sequential primary and secondary boundaries. Refined secondary boundaries are calculated for a gate-keeping test on a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks. The choices include both the standard boundaries and the boundaries using error spending functions. Version 1.0.0 was released on April 12, 2017. See Tamhane et al. (2018), "A gatekeeping procedure to test a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks", Biometrics, 74(1), 40-48.
