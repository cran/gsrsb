Description: A gate-keeping procedure to test a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks. Computations related to group sequential primary and secondary boundaries. Refined secondary boundaries are calculated for a gate-keeping test on a primary and a secondary endpoint in a group sequential design with multiple interim looks. The choices include both the standard boundaries and the boundaries using error spending functions.
